## What This Repository Shows

This repo is meant to be a **clear, non-intimidating proof** that I:

- Can organize a small project in GitHub.
- Can work with basic Python / Flask code.
- Am actively exploring how to blend scripture, curriculum, and technology in a careful way.

It is intentionally simple and small. It is not a startup, a product launch, or a claim to be a senior engineer.

## Files to Look At

- **`README.md`**  
  High-level description of the repository and its purpose.

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  A short list of Python packages used by the sample app.

- **`src/prophecy-analyzer/app.py`**  
  A tiny Flask application that:
  - Creates a small SQLite database with a couple of example scripture rows.
  - Exposes an `/analyze` endpoint that looks for a keyword in the input text and returns matching example rows.
  - Includes timestamp and location in the response for context.

- **This file (`evidence-sheet.md`)**  
  A plain-language explanation for reviewers who do not read code.

## How to Use This for Applications

When a school, program, or employer asks for evidence of technical work, I can share:

- GitHub link: `https://github.com/madiwynn/wynnwillow-ai-theology`

They can:

- Read `README.md` to understand the idea.
- Skim `app.py` to see real but simple code.
- Use this evidence sheet to quickly grasp how it fits my background as a teacher, designer, and learner.

## Next Steps (Planned)

Over time, I may add:

- A `curricula-builder/` folder with simple scripts or markdown-based lesson frameworks.
- A `family/` or `scavenger-hunt/` folder with small, kid-friendly activities.
- More documentation written in plain language, keeping everything understandable and honest.
