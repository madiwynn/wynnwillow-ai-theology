# Curricula Builder (Planning Area)

This folder is reserved for simple tools and documents that help:

- Plan lessons or discussions around scripture.
- Break big ideas into small, age-appropriate steps.
- Support families and teachers with gentle structure.

Right now, this is a placeholder to show how the project will grow.  
Future additions might be:

- Markdown lesson outlines.
- Simple Python scripts that suggest topics or questions.
- PDF handouts exported from other tools.
