This repository is a simple, honest portfolio for my experiments at the intersection of **scripture, education, and gentle tech**. It is not a finished product or a complex framework—it is proof that I am learning, building, and showing my work.

I’ve kept this repo deliberately small and readable so non‑technical reviewers (principals, hiring managers, program leads) can understand what they’re looking at.

## How to View

- Browse the code directly on GitHub (start with `src/prophecy-analyzer/app.py`).
- Read `evidence-sheet.md` for a plain‑language explanation of what this is and how it fits my story.
